# Deep learning model for the automatic classification of COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy: A multi-center retrospective study   

This repository includes source code of our paper (deep learning model for classification between COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy on chest X-ray image (accepted)). Our model is based on EfficientNet. The detail of the model is described in our paper. 



# Requirement
The source code is written in Python (version 3.7 or later). 
Scikit-learn, tensroflow, keras, and efficient packages are required for training and evaluating the model. 



# Dataset 
The public datasets used for the paper are (i) COVIDx dataset and (ii) COVID_BIMCV dataset.  
The details of these public datasets are described in the paper. 

1. COVIDx dataset (version 5):
